BUGS:

DEVELOPMENT STORIES:
cloud backup
    already fine with android auto-backup?
implement subcategories
make categories unique in DB
implement pagination
implement sorting
add created date and other columns for sorting
make average spinner trigger recalc
tests
show date
make date editable
check for updates
delete category: delete or uncategorize transactions?

UI STORIES:
Drawer behavior - make only one open at a time?
    drawer should close when action bar is clicked
validation design
expense/income background colors
grey button background
really need nested categories?
what if want to select a supercategory?
analyze button in category fragment
    will need to change the way resume is handled - category field
refine empty list design
empty plot design
create category in category list
auto save on exit
ellipsize transaction amount?
make widget look better
single list item no border
monthly average seems weird when looking at small date range
make it easier to add a category to an uncategorized transaction?
is it weird to go back to view page after edit?
should do something other than clear backstack on delete?

BEST PRACTICES / CLEANUP:
Watch out for support library stuff - e.g. using both FragmentManager and getSupportFragmentManager
action buttons hide/show - check for string title okay?
move hardcoded font sizes and other dimensions to dimens.xml
list fragments onclick may be too general - need to make sure it's a list item
protect nullptr exceptions?
too much work on UI thread?
Move database stuff to AsyncTask
should functions be in MainActivity or fragments?
duplicated code between edit and view transaction?
redundancy between categorylistfragment and selectcategorydialogfragment?
confirm that Category.getChildren is not doing a copy
bad practice to use getFragmentById, esp. without null check? selectCategoryDialogFragment
unify member variable order
    order of appearance in code?
    UI order?
    separate views / data?
locale problems with String.format?
null checks on BudgetDatabase.getInstance?
BudgetDatabase Log.e instead of throw enough?
updateTransactionByID or updateTransaction with required ID in Transaction?
database migrations
are correct files included vs gitignored?
make sure code is happening in correct lifecycle methods to avoid redundancy
all functions should error check inputs?
duplicated zero-padding code for amounts, possible other display amount logic
